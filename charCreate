function character = charCreate(n)
%charCreate - creates different characters with various traits
%   num - order of character creation (used to make sure data is random)
%   age - character's age (1-5; 1 is young, 5 is old)
%   height - character's height (1-5, 1 is short, 5 is tall)
%   bmi - character's weight (1-5, 1 is skinny, 5 is fat)

%assign traits to characters following a normal distribution

%find mu and sigma for values between 1-5
%valRange = [1 2 3 4 5]';
%muSigma = fitdist(valRange,'Normal'); %finds mu and sigma using valRange
mu = 3;
sigma = 1.58114

%assign random values of traits along a normal distribution to characters
for c1 = 1:n
    person.num(c1) = c1;
    person.age(c1) = normrnd(mu,sigma);
    person.height(c1) = normrnd(mu,sigma);
    person.bmi(c1) = normrnd(mu,sigma);
